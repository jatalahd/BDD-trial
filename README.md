This is work in progress, nothing special to see here.

Notes to myself:

Run the top-level pom as: 

mvn clean install

The resulting standalone jar can be run independently as:

export CLASSPATH=JBStoryRunner-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

java org.junit.runner.JUnitCore org.jb.JBStoryRunner
